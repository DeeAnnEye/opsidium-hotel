        At CH, we believe great food is more than a meal – it’s a story of
        tradition, flavor, and love. Our kitchen is famous for two things: the
        rich aroma of our slow-cooked biryanis and the irresistible sweetness of
        our handcrafted halwas. Every dish is prepared with the freshest
        ingredients, authentic recipes, and a passion for perfection. Whether
        you’re here for a hearty feast or a sweet treat, we promise a taste that
        feels like home.
